I am a third-year undergraduate student in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. I engage in developing an agent that can understand and interact with the multi-modal world. Toward this goal, my research mainly focus on:

* <b>Embodied AI</b>: Visual Navigation; Dexterous manipulation; 
* <b>Multi-Modal Large Models</b>: Multi-Agent Systems; Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); Knowledge Refinement for Long-Text Data
