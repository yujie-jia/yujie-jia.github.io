I am a third-year undergraduate student in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. I engage in developing intelligent systems that can understand and interact with the multi-modal world. Currently, my research interests mainly focus on:

**Multi-Modal Large Models & AI Education**
- Multi-modal Knowledge Representation and Fusion
- Intelligent Commentary Generation for Experimental Teaching
- Multi-Agent Systems for Personalized Knowledge Learning

**Embodied AI & Decision Making**
- Retrieval-Augmented Decision Making for Intelligent Agents
- Multi-modal Knowledge Alignment and Decision Optimization
- Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments


As an undergraduate researcher in the early stages of my academic journey, I maintain an open mindset and am enthusiastic about exploring emerging technologies in AI.
Feel free to contact me if you're interested in discussing or seeking potential collaborations.
