<br />
I am a third-year undergraduate student in the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. I engage in developing intelligent systems that can understand and interact with the multi-modal world. Currently, my research interests mainly focus on:

* <b>Multi-Modal Large Models</b>: Multi-Agent Decision Systems; Multi-Modal Fusion and Alignment; Multi-Modal Knowledge Integration
* <b>Embodied AI</b>: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments; Dexterous manipulation

As an undergraduate researcher in the early stages of my academic journey, I maintain an open mindset and am enthusiastic about exploring emerging technologies in artificial intelligence~
