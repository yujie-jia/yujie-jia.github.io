title: "ExpStar: Towards Automatic Commentary Generation for Multi-discipline Scientific Experiments"
description: "(i) We construct ExpInstruct, the first dataset tailored for experiment commentary generation, featuring over 7K step-level commentaries across 21 scientific subjects. Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with potential scientific principles and safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpStar achieves state-of-the-art performance, and outperforms 16 leading LMMs. (paper page coming soon)"
