title: "ExpStar: Towards Automatic Commentary Generation for Multi-discipline Scientific Experiments"
description: "We construct ExpInstruct, the first dataset tailored for experiment commentary generation, featuring over 7K step-level commentaries across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines . Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with potential scientific principles and safety guidelines. We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge.(paper page private for now)"
